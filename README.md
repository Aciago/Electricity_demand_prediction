- Time Series analysis and predictions
- Smoothing methods for Time Series
- ARMA, Holt-Winters method, AutoSARIMA, SARIMA

### :briefcase: Scenario:
We are working for a french energy company that specializes in renewable energies. Given the nature of our energy production, it is difficult to predict electricity production capacities. Moreover, the demand for electricity from users varies over time, and depends on parameters such as the weather (temperature, luminosity, etc.). The challenge is to match supply and demand!

### :package: Dataset:
Our dataset came in form of CSV files for [electricity consumption](https://www.rte-france.com/eco2mix/telecharger-les-indicateurs) and [weather data](https://cegibat.grdf.fr/simulateur/calcul-dju).
